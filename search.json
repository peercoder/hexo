Title: Shitsurakuen (Lost Paradise) Year Released: 1997 Directed By: Yoshimitsu Morita Running Time: 119 Minutes Genre: Drama Language: Japanese IMDB Link:  Review (taken from IMDB) ***Caution May or May not contain spoilers.*** It is really beautiful, every moment, every performance, every scene, natural and artistic, yet so moving and striking to me that I really can not breathe in the end. There is something deep in your soul, which you may never experience in your life. But when it comes to you and you realize that, you jump at it, no matter what consumes, your job, family, even your life. The most amazing part of this movie is that, when I watch it, I know it is a very strong and passionate one (I have read the original book and I adore it), but every step it takes happens so natural and real that you feel it is just the fate and inevitable. It is not just a romantic story about forbidden love, there is something deeper and more serious inside, where is the real life and love in this modern, developed society? I have long felt there is a aesthetic yet self-destructive tendency in many Japanese novels and movies, just like and blossom of cherry flowers. This one provide another sample. As usual Koji Yakusho, my favorite current male Japanese actor delivers a very convincing performance. This is my first time to see Hitomi Kuroki. She plays exactly the character in the book, sometimes even better and far beyond it. I do not know how to describe her beauty and acting, it is too perfect, I really love her in this movie. If I were Sholchiro Kuki, I would do everything to make her a happy and complete life. I guess this movie is not the cup of tea for everyone. First of all, the story itself may be controversial in some sense, going against the conventional moral values. Second, there are quiet a lot sizzling sex scenes. I have to admit, some of them are very arousing and erotic, but they are naturally beautiful with no pretense. To this point,the only comparable movies I can remember are: Damage, The lover, and Unfaithful. By the way I also would like to recommend the original book with the same title by the renowned Japanese writer Junichi Watanabe. In my eyes, he is the counterpart of D.H.Lawrence in Asia in that both can write sex in such a real and beautiful way.

We can’t rule out the gorgeous NKG’s in sexy lingerie and at times being hosed down while wearing that same lingerie. I’ve read several reviews of this film and I think that most ignorant viewers, more into Hollywood blockbusters would consider the 15 second scene 5 minutes into the film that is a little obscured and maybe dark - drew conclusions too early and didn’t bother to watch the rest of the film. Of course this is more time spent than blockheads who haven’t seen it and want to moan about the details of a torrent someone takes the time to upload. There are some scenes outdoors at night that are a little dark - but one expects that as opposed to unrealistic lighting. I am more impressed with the arthouse nature of this movie which is closer to a Kaurismï¿½ki “movie about nothing” than Star Wars. The editing of scenes are most notable - second of course to the nasty NKG’s. Oh yes the rampant erotic sex. Plenty of that also. A landmark film certain to be elevated some day to the same status as Metropolis, Ben Hur, Gone With The Wind and La Dolce Vita. review by subprimitive Lee Ji-sang’s hardcore adult Korean film Yellow Flower dramatizes the erogenous encounters of a group of Asian men and women, who explore the limits of their own sexuality by participating in deviant, perverse, and bizarre coital acts with one another. Like Nagisa Oshima’s In the Realm of the Senses and Ryu Murakami’s Tokyo Decadence, Yellow Flower helped to obliterate the censorship of sexual content in motion pictures, throughout Asia. Jung Suh, Kim Jung-ki, and Jang Mi-ru co-star. (from allmovie) IMDb Link……:  Genre…………: Drama / Romance / Erotica Distributor……: Attari Year………….: 2002 Country……….: Korea Director………: Lee Ji-sang"}]
